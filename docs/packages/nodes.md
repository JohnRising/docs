# Blockchain Nodes

Stackup offers [nodes as a service](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/nodes-as-a-service/) so that you can focus on building your app instead of running infrastructure.

Blockchain nodes are individual computers or devices that participate in a blockchain network. To connect to a blockchain network, you need to connect to a node. JSON RPC requests can be sent using the same API key as your bundler instance.

## Ethereum Mainnet & Goerli

Stackup supports Ethereum Mainnet and Ethereum Goerli testnet. You can find the [supported JSON RPC requests](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/).

## Polygon Mainnet & Mumbai

Stackup supports Polygon Mainnet and Polygon Mumbai testnet. Polygon supports the [standard Ethereum JSON RPC requests](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/).
