All commands can be ran with the following format:

```bash
yarn run PackageName <command> --flag=value
```

## Managing stake

A `Paymaster Contract` must stake a blockchain's native token (usually ETH) to the `EntryPoint` contract in order to sponsor a wallet's `UserOperation`. These commands are used to help manage the stake on a supported `EntryPoint`.

### `addStake`

Adds stake to a `Paymaster Contract`.

In order to consent to being a paymaster, a `Paymaster Contract` will need to send and lock an amount of ETH to the `EntryPoint` to be staked. It can only be unlocked after a given time set by `unstakeDelaySec`. This action will also cancel any pending unlock.

:::tip

Use this command to initialize your contract as a `Paymaster Contract`. If you are topping up your balance, use `depositTo` instead.

```bash
yarn run PackageName addStake
```

| `unstakeDelaySec` | The amount in seconds to wait before a stake can be fully unlocked. Must be more than or equal to the minimum set by the `EntryPoint`. | The minimum set by the `EntryPoint` (86400 seconds). |

### `unlockStake`

Sets the stake to be unlocked. The staked funds can be withdrawn after the time specified by `unstakeDelaySec`.

```bash
yarn run PackageName unlockStake
```
