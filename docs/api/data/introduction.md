# Introduction

Stackup's Data API gives you easy and efficient access to UserOperation data
across all networks supported by Stackup. You can retrieve crucial information
about UserOperation transactions and calculate gas costs for transactions
sponsored by Paymasters.

In the following sections, you'll find detailed information about how to:

- [Authenticate](./authentication) with the Data API

- [Interact](./useroperations/the-useropdata-object) with the available endpoints

- [Handle responses](./pagination) to effectively integrate the Data API into your application

- [Handle errors](./errors) and rate limits
