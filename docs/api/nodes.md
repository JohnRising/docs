# Blockchain Nodes

Stackup offers [nodes as a service](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/nodes-as-a-service/) so that you can focus on building your app instead of running infrastructure.

A node is an individual computer or device that participates in a blockchain network. To connect to the blockchain you'll need access to a node, typically via JSON-RPC. **With Stackup hosted services, you can access both nodes and bundlers through a single URL and API key.**

- [JSON-RPC API for Bundlers](../packages/bundler/rpc-methods)
